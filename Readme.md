A racing game a made as a simple project to teach myself Javascript. For game engine I ended up using the Panda 2 engine because of good reviews. In the end I decided to quit the project because, among other issues with Panda 2, it did not support masking with polygons. It also seemed like the Panda 2 project had been abandoned by its author.
The project remade with Pixi.js and Typescript can be found  [here](https://github.com/kimrs/flappy-keese)
